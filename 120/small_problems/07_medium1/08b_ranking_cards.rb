Further Exploration

You will need the original exercise solution for the next two exercises.
If you work on this Further Exploration, keep a copy of your original
solution so you can reuse it.

Assume you're playing a game in which cards of the same rank are unequal.
In such a game, each suit also has a ranking. Suppose that, in this game,
a 4 of Spades outranks a 4 of Hearts which outranks a 4 of Clubs which
outranks a 4 of Diamonds. A 5 of Diamonds, though, outranks a 4 of Spades
since we compare ranks first. Update the Card class so that #min and #max
pick the card of the appropriate suit if two or more cards of the same
rank are present in the Array.
