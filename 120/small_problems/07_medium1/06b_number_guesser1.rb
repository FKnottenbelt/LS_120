Further Exploration

You will need the original exercise solution for the next exercise. If you
work on this Further Exploration, keep a copy of your original solution so
you can reuse it.

We took a straightforward approach here and implemented a single class. Do

should be part of it? How many Player objects do you need? Should you use
inheritance, a mix-in module, or a collaborative object?
