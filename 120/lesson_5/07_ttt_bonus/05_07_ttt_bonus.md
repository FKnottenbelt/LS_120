# OO TTT Bonus Features

Review the "bonus" features from the procedural TTT program, and
incorporate all of them here, in the OO version:

## Bonus" features from the procedural TTT program
### 1 - Improved "join"
If we run the current game, we'll see the following prompt:

=> Choose a position to place a piece: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

This is ok, but we'd like for this message to read a little better.
We want to separate the last item with a "or", so that it reads:

=> Choose a position to place a piece: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9

Currently, we're using the Array#join method, which can only insert
a delimiter between the array elements, and isn't smart enough to
display a joining word for the last element.

Write a method called joinor that will produce the following result:
```
joinor([1, 2])                   # => "1 or 2"
joinor([1, 2, 3])                # => "1, 2, or 3"
joinor([1, 2, 3], '; ')          # => "1; 2; or 3"
joinor([1, 2, 3], ', ', 'and')   # => "1, 2, and 3"
```
Then, use this method in the TTT game when prompting the user to
mark a square.

##### possible solution:
```ruby
def joinor(arr, delimiter=', ', word='or')
  case arr.size
  when 0 then ''
  when 1 then arr.first
  when 2 then arr.join(" #{word} ")
  else
    arr[-1] = "#{word} #{arr.last}"
    arr.join(delimiter)
  end
end
```
Using a case statement works well here because we need to perform
different actions based on the number of elements in arr. If arr
has 2 elements, then a delimiter isn't required and we can just
print the 2 elements, separated by the value of word. If arr has
more than 2 elements, then we permanently mutate the last element
with arr[-1] = and prepend the value of word. After we've modified
the last array element, we can just use Array#join to join the
elements.

Then, you could use it in the game like this:
```ruby
prompt "Choose a position to place a piece:
#{joinor(empty_squares(brd), ', ')}"
```
### 2- Keep score
Keep score of how many times the player and computer each win.
Don't use global or constant variables. Make it so that the first
player to 5 wins the game.











================
Allow the player to pick any marker.

Set a name for the player and computer.
