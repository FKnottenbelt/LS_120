# CRC cards

Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) cards is a way to model the
various classes of a program. While it started out as a teaching tool,
it's become a real-world tool to flesh out and design classes and map
interactions between classes. Usually, we draw up some quick CRC cards
as part of the brainstorming session to come up with our classes.

We only want to list the public methods that can or should be called
from outside the class.

on top of T to the left: name of class
on top of T to the right: name of superclass and or subclasses
left botom: methods (responsibilities)
right botom: colaborators

CRC cards are yet another tool to help you organize your ideas. You
don't have to use it if you don't find it helpful. In general, you
should follow the below approach.

    Write a description of the problem and extract major nouns and verbs.

    Make an initial guess at organizing the verbs and nouns into methods
    and classes/modules, then do a spike to explore the problem with
    temporary code.

    When you have a better idea of the problem, model your thoughts into
    CRC cards.
