# Requirements for the bonus features

Assignment: RPS Bonus Features

Below are some ideas for features or additions to our Rock, Paper,
Scissors game.

# 1 Keeping score
Right now, the game doesn't have very much dramatic flair. It'll be
more interesting if we were playing up to, say, 10 points. Whoever
reaches 10 points first wins. Can you build this functionality? We
have a new noun -- a score. Is that a new class, or a state of an
existing class? You can explore both options and see which one works
better.

# 2 Add Lizard and Spock
This is a variation on the normal Rock Paper Scissors game by adding
two more options - Lizard and Spock. The full explanation and rules
are here: http://www.samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html
```
scissors cuts paper covers rock crushes
lizard poisons spock smashes scissors
decapitates lizard eats paper disproves
spock vaporizes rock crushes scissors.
```

# 3 Add a class for each move
What would happen if we went even further and introduced 5 more
classes, one for each move: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, and Spock.
How would the code change? Can you make it work? After you're done,
can you talk about whether this was a good design decision? What are
the pros/cons?

# 4 Keep track of a history of moves
As long as the user doesn't quit, keep track of a history of moves
by both the human and computer. What data structure will you reach
for? Will you use a new class, or an existing class? What will the
display output look like?

# 5 Adjust computer choice based on history
Come up with some rules based on the history of moves in order for
the computer to make a future move. For example, if the human tends
to win over 60% of his hands when the computer chooses "rock", then
decrease the likelihood of choosing "rock". You'll have to first
come up with a rule (like the one in the previous sentence), then
implement some analysis on history to see if the history matches
that rule, then adjust the weight of each choice, and finally have
the computer consider the weight of each choice when making the move.
Right now, the computer has a 33% chance to make any of the 3 moves.

# 6 Computer personalities
We have a list of robot names for our Computer class, but other than
the name, there's really nothing different about each of them.
It'd be interesting to explore how to build different personalities
for each robot. For example, R2D2 can always choose "rock". Or, "Hal"
can have a very high tendency to choose "scissors", and rarely "rock",
but never "paper". You can come up with the rules or personalities for
each robot. How would you approach a feature like this?
