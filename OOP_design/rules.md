## How to write easy to change code.

# 1- Insist it be simple
Your goal is to modle your application, using classes, such that is does what is
supposed to do right now and also easy to change later

# 2- Creating classes that have a single responsibility
A class should do the smallest possible useful thing; that is, it should have a
single responsibility.
